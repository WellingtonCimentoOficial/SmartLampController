The script contains a total of 4 main options on your home screen that are used to send commands to your Yeelight Smart Led Bulb (COLOR) device such as:
* ON
* OFF
* BRIGHTNESS
* COLORS

Below we have some images that show the functions mentioned above ...

# Initial Setting

The first time the script is run, you will be required to enter the internal IP of the Yeelight Smart Led Bulb (COLOR) device. After providing the information and giving an ENTER this information will be stored in a .txt file that will be saved in "C:\Users\USER\Documents" with the name "LampController_file_ip.txt". Then we can use all the script's functions. If the device's ip changes, just delete the file "LampController_file_ip.txt" and run the script, so you can provide the device's new ip address again.

* Image 1 - Home Screen

In this image we have the main menu that appears right when we run the script. We have 4 options that we can choose, in option 1 and 2 we can turn the device on and off using the option number or by typing the option. Next we have options 3 and 4, so option 3 to change the brightness of the lamp and option 4 to choose a predefined color for the device. In addition to the options mentioned, we have one last option which is the option to close the script using 00 or by typing exit.

  In addition to using the option numbers in the menu, we can type what we want to do as: ON, OFF, BRILHO e CORES.

* Image 3 - Brightness Menu

Here we have option 3 which has the function of increasing and decreasing the brightness of our Lamp. We can choose the brightness in a value from 1 to 100, being 1 for the minimum brightness and 100 for the maximum brightness. In addition we can use 0 or voltar to return to the previous menu.

* Image 4 - Saturation Menu

In this menu you can control the saturation of the lamp, and you can set a value of 1 for a weaker color and 100 for a stronger color. Between these two values, we can set any number for more possibilities.

* Image 5 - Temperature Menu

Here we were able to change the color temperature from 1700 to 6500, 1700 for a hotter color and 6500 for a colder color. Among these values, it was possible to acquire different colors, the higher the set value, the colder the lamp's color will be.

* Image 6 - Colors Menu

In this last image we have option 4 where we can define a color for our yeelight lamp. So 1 for white, 2 for blue, 3 for red, 4 for yellow, 5 for purple, 6 for green, 00 for returning and 0 for leaving.

# Geral Description

* Português

ESSE SCRIPT CONSEGUIRÁ CONTROLAR SUA LÂMPADA YEELIGHT SMART LED BULB (COLOR) ATRAVÉS DE UM TERMINAL LINUX OU WINDOWS UTILIZANDO FUNÇÕES BÁSICAS COMO LIGAR,
DESLIGAR, BRILHO, SATURAÇÃO, TEMPERATURA E CORES PRÉ DEFINIDAS, PODENDO ASSIM SER DESENVOLVIDO SOFTWARES MAIS COMPLEXOS COM BASE NESSE CÓDIGO.
ATRAVÉS DESSA IDEIA PODERÁ SER CRIADO SOFTWARES, COMO ALGUM PROGRAMA DE AÚDIO QUE TEM COMO FUNCIONALIDADE FAZER COM QUE A LÂMPADA EXECUTE UMA FUNÇÃO DESEJADA
DE ACORDO COM A BATIDA DE UMA MÚSICA, PODERÁ UTILIZAR JUNTO A UMA INTELIGÊNCIA ARTIFICIAL EXECUTANDO ASSIM COMANDOS DE VOZ E ETC. ESSES FORAM APENAS 2 EXEMPLOS,
DAQUI PARA FRENTE VAI DA SUA CRIATIVIDADE CRIAR ALGUM SOFTWARE QUE TENHA OUTRAS FUNCIONALIDADES E OUTROS OBJETIVOS.
OBS: ESSE CÓDIGO NÃO FOI TESTADO EM OUTRO MODELO ALÉM DO DESCRITO ACIMA.

* English

THIS SCRIPT WILL BE ABLE TO CONTROL YOUR YEELIGHT SMART LED BULB (COLOR) LAMP THROUGH A LINUX OR WINDOWS TERMINAL USING BASIC FUNCTIONS HOW TO TURN ON,
TURN OFF, BRIGHTNESS, SATURATION, TEMPERATURE AND PRE-DEFINED COLORS, SO MORE COMPLEX SOFTWARE CAN BE DEVELOPED BASED ON THIS CODE.
THROUGH THIS IDEA SOFTWARES CAN BE CREATED, SUCH AS AN AUDIO PROGRAM WITH FUNCTIONALITY TO MAKE THE LAMP PERFORM A DESIRED FUNCTION
ACCORDING TO THE BEATING OF A MUSIC, YOU CAN USE IT WITH AN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE THROUGH PERFORMING VOICE COMMANDS AND ETC. THESE WERE ONLY 2 EXAMPLES,
Henceforth IT WILL BE YOUR CREATIVITY TO CREATE SOME SOFTWARE THAT HAS OTHER FUNCTIONALITIES AND OTHER OBJECTIVES.
NOTE: THIS CODE WAS NOT TESTED IN ANY MODEL OTHER THAN THE DESCRIBED ABOVE.
